    <p>Your price was {{ price }}.</p>

        {% if is_sole_winner %}
            You won the price competition; you had the lowest price.
        {% elif is_shared_winner %}
            {{ num_winners }} participants tied for the lowest price; you were one of them.
        {% else %}
            You did not have the lowest price, which was {{ winning_price }}.

    <p>Your payoff is therefore {{ payoff }}</p>
