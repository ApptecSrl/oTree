The participant with the lowest price carries the day and becomes the winner.    </p>    <p>        The minimum price to set is {{ minimum_price }}. The maximum price to set is {{ maximum_price }}.    </p>    <p>        The winner's payoff is calculated as the lowest price set minus the minimum price(taken as marginal costs).        The loser has nothing to gain, hence no payoff. In case of a tie, then the payoff is the average of price        set by the two participants minus minimum price.    </p>{% endblock %}
