## About

oTree is a Django-based framework that makes it easy to implement multiplayer decision strategy games.  
Many of the details of writing a web application are abstracted away, 
meaning that the code is focused on the logic of the game,
and oTree programming is accessible to programmers without advanced experience in web app development.

See the live demo [here](http://demo.otree.org/).

This repository contains the games; the oTree core libraries are [here](https://github.com/oTree-org/otree-core).

## Quick start
After forking & cloning the repo:
