    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of 3 participants. Each participant in the group is given 100 points. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0 to 100.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The contributions of all 3 participants are added up, the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor of 1.8, and the resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is evenly split among all 3
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus the amount you did not contribute.
    </p>

    The instructions are exactly the same for all participants and will remain visible for your convenience on the bottom of all pages.
