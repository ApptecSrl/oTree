        This first screen is to give a template for understanding questions and to show you a numeric entry
        field with restricted values. Just for fun the field accepts any answer that is an odd negative number
        or any positive number including 0. Thus it will reject an invalid entry of, say -2, and ask you to try
        again after you click next, but if you enter a valid, but wrong answer, say 1 it will accept it but give
        you feedback.

        oTree can easily embed images, audio and video. <br>
        These can also be randomized by treatment or match or whatever. But sometimes one wants to create graphics
        on the fly. In oTree external plugins can be used for such specific purposes. For example below is a dynamic
        visualization using HighCharts.
