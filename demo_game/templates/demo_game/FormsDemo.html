    <p>
        Forms allow players to enter data. We already saw a numerical field that validated input to be an odd
        negative or any positive number in understanding question 1. Understanding question 2 had radio buttons
        which are for multiple choice questions with one correct answer.
    </p>

    <b>Note:</b> In all the form fields on this page we require an input, do validation, and then check for
        correctness (in the  understanding questions we chose to give you immediate feedback on correctness,
        here we choose not to).
