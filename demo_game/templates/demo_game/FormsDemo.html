    <p>
        Forms allow players to enter data. We already saw a numerical field that validated input to be an odd
        negative or any positive number in understanding question 1. Understanding question 2 had radio buttons
        which are for multiple choice questions with one correct answer.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> In all the form fields on this page we require an input, do validation, and then check for
        correctness (in the  understanding questions we chose to give you immediate feedback on correctness,
        here we choose not to).

    <p>More on form elements can be found in Djangoâ€™s documentation. If you want to know where to find that
        documentation, just for fun we hid it in a tooltip. Hover over me for the link.<br>
