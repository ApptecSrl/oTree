    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another player. Both of you see these same instructions.
        You must privately choose whether you want to <b>cooperate</b> with the other player or <b>defect</b>.
        The final amount you make will depend both on your and the other player's decision:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>If both choose to cooperate, each will receive {{ cooperate_amount }}</li>
        <li>If one chooses to cooperate, but the other chooses to defect, the former will receive {{ cooperate_defect_amount }} and the latter {{ defect_cooperate_amount }}</li>
        <li>If both choose to defect, each will receive {{ defect_amount }}</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        These rules are summarized in the table below.
    </p>
