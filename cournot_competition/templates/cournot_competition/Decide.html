It is calculated as follows:    </p>    <p>         Unit price (in points) = {{ total_capacity }} - [Units produced by you] - [Units produced by the {{ num_other_players }} companies]    </p>    <p>        Once the unit price has been calculated, your payoff is then calculated as follows:    </p>    <p>        Your payoff (in points) = [Unit price] Ã— [units produced by you]    </p>    <p>        For participating in this experiment, your payoff will be {{ units_to_money_scale }} per point.    </p>{% endblock %}
