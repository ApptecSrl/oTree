<p>You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. One of you will be selected at random to be participant A; the other will be participant B. You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any decision.</p>
<p>Participant A receives 100 points. Participant A can send some or all of his 100 points to participant B. Before B receives these points they will be tripled. Once B receives the tripled points he can decide to send some or all of his points to A.</p>
<p>The instructions are exactly the same for all participants and will remain visible for your convenience on the bottom of all pages.</p>
