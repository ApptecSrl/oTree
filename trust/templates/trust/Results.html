{% if role == 'A' %}
You chose to send participant B {{sent_amount}} points. Participant B returned {{sent_back_amount}} points.
</p>
<p>
You were initially endowed with 100 points, chose to send {{sent_amount}}, received {{sent_back_amount}} points thus you now have [100-{{sent_amount}}+{{sent_back_amount}}] points.
{% else %}
Participant A sent you {{sent_amount}} points. They were tripled so you received {{tripled_amount}} points. You chose to return {{sent_back_amount}} points.
</p>
<p>
You were initially endowed with 0 points, received {{tripled_amount}}, chose to return {{sent_back_amount}} points thus you now have [3*{{sent_amount}}-{{sent_back_amount}}] points.
