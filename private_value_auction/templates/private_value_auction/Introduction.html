Each player will know only their own private value of the item,        which may be different between players. The actual value of the item is not known.    </p>    <p>        Based on the private value, each player will submit a single bid within a given range.        All bids are private and submitted at the same time.    </p>    <p>        The highest bidder will receive the their private value of the item as payoff minus their own bid amount.        If the winner's bid amount is higher than the private value, the payoff will be zero.        In the event of a tie between two or more players, the winner will be chosen at random. Other players will receive nothing.    </p>    {% next_button %}{% endblock %}
