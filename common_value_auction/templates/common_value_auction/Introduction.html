    <p>In Common Value Auction Game, there are multiple players with each player submitting
        a bid for a prize being sold in an auction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before bidding, you will be given a 'prize value' which is the money value to you for
        the item being auctioned. The 'prize value' is common to all players.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the prize value given, each player will make a 'bid' and neither of the players
        will be able to see the other player's bid.
    </p>
    <p>
        After bidding the person with the highest bid will purchase the item being sold. In the event of
        a tie bid, the winner will be randomly chosen. The winner's payoff will be given by prize value
        minus their own bid. The other bidder (looser) will earn nothing.
